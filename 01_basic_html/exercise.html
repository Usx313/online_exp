  <h3> Try with different headings</h3>
  <p><b>Text in here is the paragraph.</b> When creating the headlines and paragraph, it seems that 
    no indention is needed.<br>
  so if you want to indent some part under the higher level, it is still good for read.</p>
  <p>this is the second paragraph, where a link to a website is inserted here. <br>
4. Add a paragraph with a link to the Linguistics Department website (http://linguistics.stanford.edu).<br />
    Let's try if it works.<br>
     Here goes the link: <a href="http://linguistics.stanford.edu">the Linguistics Department website in Stanford University</a>
